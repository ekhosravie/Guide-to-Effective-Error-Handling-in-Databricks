Error Handling in Databricks: Ensuring Robust Data Processing Pipelines

Overview
This repository contains a sample Python script demonstrating effective error handling techniques in Databricks for maintaining robust data processing pipelines.
The script addresses common scenarios encountered in data engineering workflows, such as intermittent connectivity issues,
transient failures, and resource contentions, offering strategies to handle them gracefully.

Scenario:
In a dynamic data environment, data engineers often face challenges related to error management during data processing tasks. 
This script is designed to simulate such scenarios,
providing insights into potential causes of errors and showcasing best practices for mitigating their impact.

Features: 
Custom Error Handling: Utilizes custom error handling functions to capture and log exceptions, enabling better troubleshooting and analysis.
Automatic Retry Mechanisms: Implements retry logic using the retrying library to handle transient failures gracefully and ensure job resilience.
Comprehensive Logging: Integrates logging functionality to record detailed error messages, stack traces, and execution context for improved debugging.
Real-world Scenario: Demonstrates error handling techniques in a realistic data processing scenario involving data ingestion from cloud storage and a streaming source.

Getting Started: 
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/databricks-error-handling.git
Set up a Databricks environment and configure dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.

Customize the script to fit your specific data processing requirements, such as adjusting data source paths, connection settings, and error handling logic.

Execute the script within your Databricks environment, observing the error handling mechanisms in action.

Requirements: 
Python 3.x
Databricks environment (cluster setup with appropriate configurations)
Necessary dependencies installed (specified in requirements.txt)
